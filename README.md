# Cyberark Secret Manager (formerly AAM)

## Overview  
CyberArk’s Secret Manager Credential Providers and Conjur Enterprise, part of the Privileged Access Security solution, is used to eliminate hard coded application credentials embedded in applications, scripts or configuration files, and allows these highly-sensitive passwords to be centrally stored, logged and managed within the Vault. 
This repository of downloadable scripts enable users to automate key processes across their Credential Providers and Conjur implementation.

These scripts are certified and fully supported by Cyberark.

## The Main Goal
Enable Secret Manager (AAM) users to automate and simplify application management tasks via REST APIs such as configuring dual account.
